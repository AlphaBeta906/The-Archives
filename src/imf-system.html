<p>The Archives is a collection of information regarding the collection of <i>historica</i>, materials in relation to <a href="/event-prediction">event prediction</a>, and history of the <a href="/gsa">Great Society of the Archivists</a>. The organization of these articles may seem like an impossible goal. However, we plan to use our site using IMF system, to potentially combat these issues. IMF stands for index, maps of contents and frameworks. Our objectives with using the IMF system is to make finding pages easier and create an interconnected web of articles, documents, and other such materials to help further <a href="/objectives/">our objectives</a>. The purpose of this help page is to make sure new users understand our approach in regards to the structure of The Archives.</p>

<h2>How the IMF system works</h2>

<p>The IMF system is embodied in this website in three particular places, the index, maps of contents and frameworks. The index is basically a central hub for all the maps of contents. Maps of content break down our pages into neat and distinct categories. For example, we separate our world pages from the rest of The Archives by creating their own map of content. Maps of content, can be subdivided into more maps of content for more precise categories. Pages could be in multiple maps of content. Finally frameworks are what organizes the pages in their maps of content.</p>

<h2>Why we chose the IMF system</h2>

<p>Our great leader, <a href="/altair">Altair</a> envisioned a universal authoritative source regarding all things Archivist, in contrast to the fractured and sparse knowledge captured on individual books. Upon his death, he via his will alloted his entire net worth in the <a href="/uap">Universal Archives Program</a>, which was the program which led to the creation of The Archives. One of our major objectives is to create an accessible universal source towards our goals, and we believe through the IMF we could be one step closer towards Altair's vision.</p>
