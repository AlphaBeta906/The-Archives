<p>We are the Archivists. We are a group of scholars dedicated to the preservation, research, and documentation of <i>historica</i> and <a href="/event-prediction">event prediction</a>.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>On circa 1775, our great leader <a href="/altair">Altair</a>, was transported to the <a href="/hub/">Hub of Worlds</a>. There, he met <a href="/nayaquille">Nayáquille</a>, Patron God of Learning and Knowledge, and God of Wisdom, Creativity and Arts. There he experienced an epiphany and the discovery of event prediction. He changed his name to Altair, and thus he founded the <a href="/gsa">Great Society of the Archivists</a>.</p>

<p>On December 4th, 1775, the <a href="/urpadine-creed">Urpadine Creed</a> was signed by Altair, Great Disciple <a href="/en">Tang En</a>, Great Disciple <a href="/silcritus">Silcritus of Drivorae</a>, and Great Disciple <a href="/maxmillian">James Maxmillian</a>.</p>
