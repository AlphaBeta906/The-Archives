<b>Atalassium</b> or known simply as <b>Atalass</b> is an event in the 24th-century that predicts the end of the main timeline. Atalassium was one of the last predictions of our great leader <a href="/altair">Altair</a> before his death while meditating.

Atalassium is described as a cold era where all of the worlds collapse into a desert of cobblestone and metal for a period of 1300 before the end of the timeline entirely, known by the Great Society of the Archivists as <a href="/ragnorok">Ragnarok</a>.

<h2>Post-Ragnorok</h2>
There have been predictions of a future after Ragnarok, but most of them were scrutinized by the GSA, as with the collapse of the main timeline, every derivative of the timeline would and with it. One of the proofs of Post-Ragnorok is <a href="/great-apostle">Great Apostle</a> <a href="/tong-en">Tong En</a>'s prediction of the creation of "two worlds" after Ragnorok in one of his commonplace books. However, Tong En scratched it out, and later declared Post-Ragnarok to be impossible.
